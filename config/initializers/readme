# You can place files in here to be loaded before the code is daemonized.
#
# DaemonKit looks for a file named '<config.daemon_name>.rb' and loads
# that file with as if inside a DaemonKit::Initializer block.
# 
# These files are mostly useful for operations that should fail blatantly
# before daemonizing, like loading gems.
#
# Be careful not to open any form of IO in here and expecting it to be
# open inside the running daemon since all IO instances are closed when
# daemonizing (including STDIN, STDOUT & STDERR).
